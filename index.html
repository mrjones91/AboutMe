        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
        From a young age, I've been an avid tech enthusiast. This passion took me from 
        being just a gamer to being a ninja web developer and published game developer. 
        I've discovered my drive to create meaningful and engaging experiences that are 
        intuitive to users. This drive to create is a trait that many of us have, and I've 
        taken to fostering that creativity by providing tools and know-how to others through 
        dijital Academy, where you can learn to bring your vision to life.
        </p>
        <p>
        Mastering the languages of the web: ► Javascript, HTML, and CSS ◄ has provided a great 
        background for being a well rounded developer. Building with libraries 
        like ► React, Meteor and EnchantJS ◄ has allowed me to take these tools and 
        languages to the next level by increasing my ability and understanding of web sites, 
        applications, and video games. With experience developing and teaching, I help others 
        to cross the digital divide and become makers in their own right. We have to adapt, 
        build, and live our future; not be displaced by it.

    <!-- 
        Create an About Me guessing game that utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
        Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, 
        an overview of your job experience, and any goals that you may have.
        Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user 
        input for the answer must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while 
        taking into consideration case sensitivity by normalizing the user input so that 
        it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() functions). 
        Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them 
        with a response.
        Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they 
        are correct. Before submitting, comment out (don’t delete) your console.log() 
        messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete the project.
